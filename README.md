The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems, the environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.

For this project, the data was taken from their [Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), and shows earthquakes within 24 hours. This geoJSON dataset is updated every minute, therefore the map provides real time updates on earthquakes.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in size and color, earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color. In addition, popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
